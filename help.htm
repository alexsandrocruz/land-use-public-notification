	    <h1>Online Help:</h1>
	    <p>The <b>Public Notification</b> application allows local government staff to identify properties within a given distance (buffer) of a subject property or roadway; or identify properties with a given administrative area (ex. school district).  Once a given set of properties have been identified, mailing labels and/or a comma-separated value(CSV) file can be generated for owners and occupants and used in public notification workflows.</p>
	    <h4><u>Using the Application</u></h4>
	    <p> The Public Notification application offers a simple way for applicants to find a subject property and select a set of properties by a given distance, find a roadway and select a set of properties adjacent to that roadway, or identify properties with a given administrative area.It provides a list of property owners and occupants for the selected set of properties in an Adobe PDF document that is formatted to match several standard Avery Label formats, and a simple common separated text file (.CSV) that can be used in a subsequent mail merge to produce the public notice.</p>
        <h4><u>Finding an Area of Interest</u></h4>
        <p>There are two primary ways to identify an area of interest, subject property, or roadway.  You can interact directly with the map and click on a subject property or roadway when you've located it. You can also use the Search Box to locate a subject property by address or parcel identification number or a roadway by name.</p>
        <h4><u>Map Based Navigation</u></h4>
        <p>There are several ways to interact with the map:<br /><br />1. Enter the address, parcel identification number, road name or administrative area you're interested in<br />2. Hold down the shift key and drag a box on the map to zoom in<br />3. Hold down Ctrl+Shift to zoom out<br />4. Roll your mouse roller to zoom in/out<br />5. Drag the zoom slider to zoom in/out</p>
        <h4><u>Searching</u></h4>
        <p>The search box can be used to find a subject property, roadway or administrative area:<br /><br />1. Select Search then enter the property, road, or area<br />2. Click on the item in the list to locate the address, parcel identification number, roadway, or administrative area on the map<br /><br />Note, you can enter a partial address, parcel identification number, road name, or administrative area and then identify the correct value in the list.</p>
        <h4><u>Identify Surrounding Properties and Generate a Mailing List</u></h4>
        <p>You can identify surrounding properties and generate a mailing list once you've identified a subject property or roadway. Before you start the notification process, you can add neighboring parcels or road segments to your selection. To start the notification process, you'll need to:<br /><br />1. Click the Mail button on the information popup<br />2. Enter the buffer distance (this will select every property that touches a buffer created from the perimeter of the subject property)<br />3. Select who you'd like to notify (Property Owners, Property Occupants, or both)<br />4. Select Download Avery labels in PDF format if you'd like to generate preformatted mailing labels in Avery 5160 or 5193 format<br />5. Select Download in CSV format if you'd like to generate a preformatted text file<br />6. Click Download<br />7. Select the Print button to generate a map of the selected properties</p>
        <h4><u>Identify Properties within an Administrative Area and Generate a Mailing List</u></h4>
        <p>You can identify properties within an administrative area by using Search to find the administrative area and generate a mailing list. To start the notification process, you'll need to:<br /><br />1. Click the Mail button on the information popup<br />2. Enter the buffer distance of zero, this will select every property within the administrative area<br />3. Select who you'd like to notify (Property Owners, Property Occupants, or both)<br />4. Select Download Avery labels in PDF format if you'd like to generate preformatted mailing labels in Avery 5160 or 5193 format<br />5. Select Download in CSV format if you'd like to generate a preformatted text file<br />6. Click Download<br />7. Select the Print button to generate a map of the selected properties</p>
        <h4><u>Label Alignment</u></h4>
        <p>If your labels are misaligned then, try adjusting your printer settings from “shrink to fit” to “actual page size”.  If your labels are still misaligned then, try editing the python script’s horizontal and vertical parameters to work with your printer.<br/></p>
